            <span class="material-symbols-outlined">psychology_alt</span>
            <p>Now more than ever, dynamic, unstructured, multidimensional problems, such as health disparities and environmental degradation, are the focus of discussions in the public and private sectors locally, nationally and globally. These are examples of wicked problems, problems that are characterized by their inherent complexity and the need for solution approaches that draw on diverse expertise.</p>

            <p>Wicked problems have social relevance but need not be characterized by social discord. The socially unifying but wickedly challenging race to beat cancer involves researchers from nearly every discipline in academia, industry and government, as well as clinicians, patients, families, public health experts, the media, policymakers, funders, and those who will educate the next generation of researchers and leaders. Wicked problems make it clear that communication about science-related issues is not, and cannot be, the purview of a select few.</p>

            <p>Becoming an effective communicator in any setting requires a combination of knowledge, skills and ways of thinking. As we have seen with the pressing issues of our time, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication can go terribly wrong. It can leave people with misconceptions about concepts or evidence and the process through which evidence was obtained. It can disempower people by confusing them and making them more reliant on reasoning shortcuts unsuited to the problem at hand. It can trigger any of several kinds of backfires.

            <p>When science communication goes awry, it interferes with the right of everyone to “share in scientific advancement and its benefits,” as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>

            <p>The Fleet Science Center in San Diego has many opportunities for scientists to connect with audiences of all ages.</p>
