                <h2>Why are roses red and violets blue?</h2>
                <p><img src="../images/blueRose.jpg" alt="blue rose" id="rose">Hundreds of varieties of purportedly blue roses have been commercialized, including Blue Heaven, Blue Moon, Rhapsody in Blue, Blue Bajou and Shocking Blue. The flowers are pretty shades, such as lilac, magenta or grayish purple, but only an optimistic rose breeder would call them blue. True blue roses are so challenging to make, and so desirable, that they have been called the Holy Grail of horticulture.</p>
                <p>Wild roses come in white, pink and red. Over hundreds of years, mutation, selection and hybridization have created garden roses in a variety of shapes and sizes and extended the color palette. For instance, yellow roses made their appearance in 1820. Blue roses are elusive because delphinidin (the main pigment that produces the blue hue) is not naturally found in roses.</p>
                <p>The main purpose of flower pigmentation is to allow pollinators to identify flowers against their background. The palette Mother Nature uses to paint the flowers of a particular species determines what pollinators are attracted because different species of pollinators perceive color differently. Red flowers are distinctive to hummingbirds, but not to bees, which perceive red light poorly. Some pigment patterns are invisible to us, but stand out to bees, which can detect ultraviolet light.</p>
                <p>Genetic engineering can extend a plant's color palette more dramatically than traditional breeding techniques. Making violets red and roses blue requires new pigment genes and a pH adjustment, too. Roses have been engineered with genes that enable them to produce the pigment dephinidin. The pigment accumulated in the petals, and the roses were more blue than other roses, but not really blue. That is because the pH (acidity levels) in the flowers was not ideal.</p>
                <p>The pH affects the color of some plant pigments. If you cook purple cabbage with vinegar, the cabbage becomes distinctively redder. Similarly, the vacuoles (plant cell compartments in which pigments accumulate) of roses are acidic, and in this environment the delphinidin pigment appears more red than blue.</p>
                <p>Another factor that affects delphinidin's blueness is the presence of co-pigments. These are molecules that stack together with delphinidin, forming a complex that is bluer than delphinidin alone.</p>
                <p>It is much easier to dump white roses in a vat of dye than to breed roses with the appropriate pigments, co-pigments and pH, but genetic engineering is yielding novel shades while bringing blue roses incrementally closer to reality.</p>
